# Why markdown:

Markup words quickly and easily (it is just text that is made to look better). Do not need to worry about propriety programs to view the files.

Can write plenty of html in markdown itself.

There is a program called MD Book that automatically creates an html site that uses inputted markdown text and organizes it into something that is easy to navigate. Written in rust

Create a collection of markdown files on GitHub or GitLab and store them there along with any empty files like metadata

Create a webhook to notify the server of any changes to that registry and tell the server to pull updates from the repository.
